# Privacy Policy for navAssist

Last updated: 10/9/2024

## Introduction

navAssist is a Chrome extension designed to provide AI-powered assistance for web browsing tasks. This privacy policy outlines our commitment to protecting your privacy and explains how we handle data within our extension.

## Data Collection and Use

navAssist is designed with privacy in mind and operates primarily through local processing. Here's how we handle data:

1. **Website Content**: The extension accesses the content of web pages you visit to provide summarization and context-aware AI assistance. This content is processed locally on your device and is not stored or transmitted to any external servers.

2. **User Input**: When you use features like grammar correction or text completion, your input is processed locally on your device using the Ollama AI model. No user input is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers.

3. **User Preferences**: The extension stores your preferences (such as selected AI model and UI settings) locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your device.

## Data Processing

All data processing, including AI-powered features, occurs locally on your device using the Ollama framework. navAssist does not send any of your data to external servers or third parties.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since all processing occurs locally and no user data is collected or stored externally, there is no data retention by the extension developers. You can clear any locally stored preferences through your browser's extension management interface.

## Third-Party Access

navAssist does not share, sell, or transfer any user data to third parties. All operations are performed locally on your device.

## Updates to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our practices, please contact us at ernest.ponce92@gmail.com.

## User Rights

As all data is processed locally, you maintain full control over your data. You can uninstall the extension at any time to remove all locally stored preferences.

## Compliance

navAssist is designed to comply with major data protection regulations. However, as no personal data is collected or processed externally, many typical data protection concerns do not apply to our extension.
